The overhead on this assignment is not insignificant, so make sure you get it working early.

Here are answers to questions I expect to get:

 

What do the files do?

 

File assignment2-definition.sql

You need to fill in the queries to make the tables as specified and add data as specified. You will turn this file in.


File assignment2-selection.sql

You need to fill in the queries to make the required selections.  You will turn this file in.


File assignment2-schema.pdf

This is a pdf of the relevant parts of the schema that you will use in your selection queries.

 

File Assignment2-model.mwb 
This is a MySQL workbench file if you are so inclined to use it. You do not need to do anything with this file at all if you don't want to.

 

File sakila-schema.sql

This is the table creation queries for the database that will be used in the selection queries portion of the homework. You must  run the queries in this file before you run the data insertion queries.

 

File sakila-data-smaller.sql 
This is the set of data insertion queries to load the data into the schema.

 

 What do I turn in again?

assignment2-definition.sql and assignment2-selection.sql. I should be able to copy and paste the entire files into the command line or load them into PHPMyAdmin with no errors.

 

This is way too much and I don't know what to do!

That is not a question, but don't worry, it is really not that bad.  You can ask questions if you need help with any of the logistics.
